# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION **
# GOAL: Setup an Elasticsearch cluster that satisfies a given set
#       of requirements
# REQUIRED SETUP: /
# Download the exam version of Elasticsearch
# Deploy the cluster `eoc-01-cluster`, so that it satisfies the 
#    following requirements:
#    (i)   has three nodes, named `node1`, `node2`, and `node3`,
#    (ii)  all nodes are eligible master nodes
cluster.name: eoc-01-cluster

# Bind `node1` to the IP address “151.101.2.217” and port “9201”
# Bind `node2` to the IP address “151.101.2.218” and port “9202”
# Bind `node3` to the IP address “151.101.2.219” and port “9203”
# Configure the cluster discovery module of `node2` and `node3` so
#    as to use `node1` as seed host
